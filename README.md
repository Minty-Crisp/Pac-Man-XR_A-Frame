Using only aframe.js, all graphics, animations and controls are built from within the webxr framework. Allowing this 1 game to played in a variety of ways including an immersive large screen version in VR with classic Joystick like controls. Not all elements match the original perfectly and some need a bit of improvement like even more diverse ai, better collision and the unique Pac-Man turning radius. Working on more accurate designs to improve those systems in the future for a more authentic experience. The amount of overall entities as well are pretty high (about 800), but brainstorming ways to optimize further while keeping the customizable nature of the system intact.

Another interesting tidbit about the system is that the map and dot creator are customizable to allow for a variety of maps, sizes and colors as well. Currently only the original basic map and theme are loaded, but more to come later.

This is my first huge project as I am still learning the ways of Web Development and Web XR, so please be kind when reviewing or sharing. Otherwise, I hope you enjoy the game and thank you for taking a look.
